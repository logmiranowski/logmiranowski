- ⚡ About Me:
-
-   I began writing code in middle school, at Garden Plain Elementary, where I took up HTML and CSS.
- During this time, I was able to produce my first website. Entitled the "Biodegradable Carbon Technique", this site
- served as what can only be described as a "link-tree". This sparked my interest in everything technology-related.
- However, my high school did not offer many technology-centered courses. My junior year, I enrolled in "Computer Coding",
- as the only student. Although the course offered little material, I was hooked. Following my graduation, I enrolled at Hutchinson
- Community College, completing an Associates of Science. At Hutchinson, I was introduced to Python, Java, Visual Basic,
- Cybersecurity Applications, Cisco CCNA I/Networking I, Microcomputer Applications and Literacy. Most recently, during my first year
- at Fort Hays University, I was introduced to C++. Due to this language being new to me, I am not as confident in my abilities,
- in comparison to my Python abilities. Before this past Fall, I had not revisited web development. Fortunately, I was able to
- enroll in an introductory course, where I produced my blog: [Mundane Miranowski](lamiranowski.infprojects.fhsu.edu/Mundane/). This was a daily blog, detailing my academic progress,
- as well as providing a daily joke.
